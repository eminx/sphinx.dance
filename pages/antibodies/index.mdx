## Practical Info

Antibodies is a research and performance project composed of a series of workshops: a total of 8, held every Tuesday and Thursday between 19th July and and 11th August, 2022. It is intended to synthesize a dance performance in the end of this research period with willing participants.

It is not required to participate fully, one can join only one or few of the workshops as long as there’s space. Though it is much highly preferred to have participants join for the entire period for all or most of the classes, especially for them to take part in the end performance. So we compose this together.

It will take place in, and in collaboration with: The Room Dalyan

The capacity for each session is only 8, due to the limits in space, and that we want to pursue the process in well cooperation with participants.

If you consider moving to Dalyan for this upcoming 4 weeks research and performance project, we can help you get an affordable housing via our network.

Contributions will be 100TL per session. If you attend the first 6 workshops, the last two will be free of charge. If you choose to pay ahead, it’ll be 500 TL for the total of 8 sessions. Scholarships are available but limited!

## Concept

Antibodies is about the impulsity of body to what appears to be as external factors of threat, stimuli, impulse. We’d like to research the norms of resistance, stimuli, triggery, immune, quarrel, relation and somatic actions; to/of/from one another. It concerns movements in collective spirit but in distinct and individual inspiration. It relates to actions that are seemingly spontaneous; but indeed are patterns of instincts developed in convolution of evolutionary processes.

Antibodies naturally relate to the protective proteins produced by immune systems of organisms in order to eliminate potentially harmful antigens like some bacteria and virus, from the host organism they live in or they are part of. Nevertheless this project does certainly not limit itself with the science behind this concept. Therefore welcomes and opens space for more subjective analysis and perspectives upon the concept of “Antibodies” and its diverse, inter-subjective meanings.

## In Tribute to Mika Vainio

This project is inspired by, and in tribute to Mika Vainio and his music. Therefore it will be pursued with a lot of his compositions and the inspiration they will provide. Thank you Mika and rest in peace!
