## Concept

Antibodies is about the impulsity of body to what appears to be as external factors of threat, stimuli, impulse. We’d like to research the norms of resistance, stimuli, triggery, immune, quarrel, relation and somatic actions; to/of/from one another. It concerns movements in collective spirit but in distinct and individual inspiration. It relates to actions that are seemingly spontaneous; but indeed are patterns of instincts developed in convolution of evolutionary processes.

Antibodies naturally relate to the protective proteins produced by immune systems of organisms in order to eliminate potentially harmful antigens like some bacteria and virus, from the host organism they live in or they are part of. Nevertheless this project does certainly not limit itself with the science behind this concept. Therefore welcomes and opens space for more subjective analysis and perspectives upon the concept of “Antibodies” and its diverse, inter-subjective meanings.

Antibodies is pursued in collaboration with [The Room Dalyan](https://theroomdalyan.com). Thanks to Sevda and Cem for opening space and believing in this!

## In Tribute to Mika Vainio

This project is inspired by, and in tribute to Mika Vainio and his music. Therefore it will be pursued with a lot of his compositions and the inspiration they will provide. Thank you Mika and rest in peace!
