Çalan sazın telin de aşk.
Uçan kuşun kalbin de aşk.
Bakan gözün özün de aşk.
Konuşan dilin sözün de aşk.

Biz arar buluruz bizi.
Biz sorar dururuz özü.
Nefesimiz mi rüzgarlarla?
Selam olsun.

Bu ummanın suyunda aşk.
Şu ağacın dalın da aşk.
Bu toprağın kumun da aşk.
Esen yelin nefesi aşk.

Doğan günün ışığı aşk.
Atan kalbin gizin de aşk.
Bu ateşin dumanı aşk.
Ağlayan gözün pınarı aşk.

Biz arar buluruz bizi.
Biz sorar dururuz özü.
Nefesimiz mi rüzgarlarla?
Selam olsun.

Kimler geldi,kimler geçti ?
Bu düğümü kimler çözdü ?
Kimler sazdı,kimler sözdü?
Göçenlere selam olsun.

Kimler oldu toprak ?
Kimler açtı çiçek ?
Nefesiniz mi rüzgarlarla ?
Selam olsun.

Aşkı sazan,aşkı sözen.
Biz gelmeden bizi anan.

Yetişemedik mi meclise ?
Sizi çalar,sizi söyleriz.
Nefesiniz mi rüzgarlarla ?
Selam olsun.

### Concept

The relationship of the passive manifestation of the world perceived by the subject, depending on the concept of time, of the sensible, and the subject’s attachment to the outside world, gaining a symmetrical shape with the active perception, revealing the instinct of the subject to repeat this experience consciously or unconsciously. This concept, which emerges with the repetition of habits, gains another dimension with the spontaneous formation of difference. Here, a consciously made phenomenological experience reveals a synthesis asymmetrically, breaking away from the instinct of repeating itself in the same way; which occurs only with the manifestation of a repetitive labor that the subject integrates with love.

### Practical Info

At Asimetrik, every participant is also an active organizer contributing with their work of love. It is a secluded camp full of movement & arts where all participants are active organizers at the same time. We will start with the last new moon of autumn and only those who do their work with love will be invited to participate. Contribution fee will be given as a contribution to the facility and will be allocated to meet basic expenses such as food and has been kept as appropriate as possible to facilitate participation.

We will be the only ones in our event, which will be located in one of the magnificent bays of Faralya, right at the rocky beach, and maybe most of us will swim together for the last time in 2021… We would like to thank Rocas Roja for opening up space for us.

### Labor is Love

The Labor is Love formation is developed to facilitate the interaction of artists with each other in a network of solidarity and resources, and to be economically independent as much as possible. It is the first time a meeting is held in Turkey. By organizing various events that have started in Sweden before from 2018; how to achieve our future desires, dreams and entitlements in the current economic order more sustainably and easily will be explored, and a space and communication channel will be opened so that we are equipped to present the works of ours to each other all together.

Our areas of interest include choreography, dance, theatre, yoga, tai chi, massage, capoeira, jewelry design, crafts such as knitted ceramics and contemporary art. Then there are also different topics such as alternative currencies, blockchain, astrology, women’s/men’s circles, universal basic income, artificial intelligence, digital networks etc. For those who do their work with love, a space will be opened to share their works and support will be provided. In this way, we hope that we will all be informed and inspired by each other’s art; and we hope that this culture will continue to spread and multiply like a “contagious disease”. The creation of a culture full of labor with love that will shed light on new generations will be expressed collectively, and we believe that these gatherings will recur in various mediums, times and frequencies.

### Frame

We present a frame with the intention to make it easier for contributors to calibrate their works that all come from different backgrounds. We provide you with full freedom to decide your content and medium, but we only wish that your connection to your work consists of these three important elements:

1. You love doing that work. You have your affection with it.,

2. Such temporal justifications as “success” and “failure” would not prevent you from practicing that work, or, better, they would render irrelevant for your curiosity and desire to practice it,

3. Your work is either reflective, analytical, critical, spiritual in its being or in some way for the benefit of a society you choose to relate to.
