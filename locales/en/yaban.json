    "We met with the artist Coco Villareal at the Tiyatro Medresesi within the scope of the ongoing Butoh training camp. Since he is already in Turkey for this six-week intensive training process, we had a wish to introduce him to the audiences here. After a very busy, exciting and beautiful week, he enthusiastically participated in our desire to have a movement camp/retreat together. We are excited to share this unique artform by Coco in Turkey with you all...",
    "Coco Villareal is originally from Mexico and currently resides in a rural village in Andalusia, Spain, with his students and friends on his own small but independent theater space. At the same time, he is frequently invited to different parts of the world and gives workshops, performances and talks, as he does now.",
    "Practicing Capoeira with Brazilian Mestre Kiura in Stockholm for about five years, Emin Durak created the movement system Spiral Sphinx, which he defines as a `Somatic Continuity Framework`, inspired by the contemporary dance culture he was in and the different improvisation practices he took part. Then he founded the company Sphinx Dance to publish his artistic works."
