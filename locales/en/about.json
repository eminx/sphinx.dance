    "Sphinx Dance is an independent nomadic studio devoted to synthesize movement based artworks and processes in varying situations, contexts and environments.",
    "Works synthesized and processes pursued by Sphinx Dance often relate to contemporary art & dance as scopes, as well as ancient rituals, practices, statues, symbolism, and even esotericism and occultism at times. Sphinx Dance do not limit itself by genres or media, or even a type of audience; and rather continously deconstruct and reconstruct notions of time and its perception. Therefore Kant's theorems regarding phenomenon and noumenon and subject's capacity to apprehend a situation, or an art work, are within direct interests of Sphinx Dance research methods.",
    "Media in which Sphinx Dance works are mediated often vary in form and do strongly matter in matter; whether that be devised as a story for camera as a film or photography, performed as a ritual, settled as an installation with sound and/or light, exhibited as a tangible, a participatory workshop, a musical experience or a staged choreography. The common thing almost always is about the authenticity of the matter of the idea in its unescapable urge to be released; and the curiosity that occurs with delving into an intriguing, endless research process.",
    "Sphinx Dance is founded and directed by Emin Durak, and there are a number of individuals who have inspired its birth and evolution: Mestre Zumbi & Mestre Kiura, Tom Weksler, Eva Georgitsopoulou, Frey Faust, Åska Saga Eriksson, Moa Westerlund, Love (Kim) Källman, Tobias Kiefer, Sebastian Lingserious and Nefeli Oikonomou."
